# TypeScript 2 + Express + Node.js + MongoDB

This is a repository to go with my article on creating an Express web application using TypeScript 2.

This repository takes some of the code from [Brian Love's repo found here](https://github.com/blove/typescript-express-starter/tree/1-mongodb) 
and splice's it together with the data pattern in [Brad Traversy's repo found here](https://github.com/bradtraversy/meanauthapp).
